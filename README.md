# Advanced-OOP-Sokoban-Project
This project is a completed variant model of "Sokoban" which was made as a group project to script an object oriented program. 
The main focus was to implement optimal patterns in order to make all added classes modular.

Project was made by Nicholas Sjögren, Filip Vikström and William Olsson.
